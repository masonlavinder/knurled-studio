/**

 * Every rule here encodes a rule from the design direction. If a design rule

 *
 * The exceptions are narrow and expressed as values, not as file carve-outs,
 * so they cannot quietly widen:
 *   · hex colors are legal only in tokens.css
 *   · box-shadow is legal only as the chamfer focus ring
 *   · repeating-linear-gradient is legal — the knurl needs it
 *   · a 1ms duration is legal — the reduced-motion block needs it
